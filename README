EZDBI provides an easy, simple interface to SQL databases from
Perl.   Here's an example program written with EZDBI:

        #!/usr/bin/perl

        use EZDBI;

	Connect 'mysql:test' => 'user', 'password';

        Insert 'into names values', 'Harry', 'Potter';

        if (Select q{* from names where first = 'Harry'} ) {
          print "Potter is IN THE HOUSE.\n";
        }

        for (Select 'last from names') {
          next if $seen{$_}++;
          my @first = Select 'first from names where last = ?', $_;
          print "$_: @first\n";
        }

        Delete q{from names where last='Potter'};

        if (Select q{* from names where last = 'Potter'} ) {
          die "Can't get rid of that damn Harry Potter!";
        }


You are not required to manage the DBI objects yourself, everything
is done behind the scenes. Complex queries are possible. All you do
is call the functions.  If you're retrieving data, it comes back as
simple arrays.
