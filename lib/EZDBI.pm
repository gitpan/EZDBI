=head1 NAME

EZDBI - EZ (Easy) interface to SQL databases (DBI)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use EZDBI;

  Connect   'type:database', 'username', 'password', ...;
  Connect   {label=>'section', ...};

  Delete    'From TABLE Where field=?, field=?', ...;

  Insert    'Into TABLE', \%values;
  Insert    'Into TABLE Values', ...;

  @rows   =  Select 'field, field From TABLE Where field=?, ...;
  $n_rows = (Select 'Count(*)     From TABLE Where field=?, ...)[0];

  Update    'TABLE Set', \%values, ...;
  Update    'TABLE Set field=?, field=?', ...;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This file documents version 0.120 of B<EZDBI>. It assumes that you already
know the basics of SQL. It is not a(n) SQL tutorial.

B<EZDBI> provides a simple and convenient interface to most common SQL
databases. It requires that you have installed the B<DBI> module and
the database driver (B<DBD> module) for whatever database you will be using.

All of the EZDBI commands support I<placeholders> (C<?>), assuming the
B<DBD> you are using does as well. You should always use placeholders where
possible as they increase performance and prevent some potential mishaps.
For example, the following code would fail due to an imbalanced number of
single quotes if C<$name=q(O'Reilly)>.

  Select "firstname From ACCOUNTS Where lastname='$lastname'"

Instead do

  Select "firstname From ACCOUNTS Where lastname='?'", $lastname

Also note that the Perl value C<undef> is converted to the SQL C<NULL>
value by placeholders:

  Select '* From ACCOUNTS Where occupation=?', undef
  # selects records where occupation is NULL

=head2 C<Connect>

Creates a connection to the database. There are two means of B<Connect>ing to
a database with B<EZDBI>. The first is:

  Connect 'type:database', ...;

The C<type> is the B<DBD> you are using eg;
C<mysql>, C<Oracle>, C<Pg> (for PostgreSQL), C<CSV> (for text files).
C<database> is the name of the database.
For example, if you want to connect to a MySQL database named 'accounts',
use C<mysql:accounts>.

Any additional arguments will be passed directly to the database. This is
difficult to document because every database is a little different. Typically,
you supply a username and a password here if the database requires them.
Consult the documentation of your B<DBD> for more information.

The second way to connect to a database is especially useful if you maintain
many scripts that use the same connection information, it allows you store
your connection parameters in an B<AppConfig> (Windows INI) format file,
which is compatible with B<DBIx::Connect>.

    Connect {
             label=>'section',
             database=>'db',
             ini=>'file',
             attr=>{ ... }
            };

=over

=item I<label>

Required. It indicates which section of the resource file contains the
pertinent connection information.

=item I<database>

Optional. If supplied it replaces the special value I<?> at the end of the dsn
from the resource file.

=item I<ini>

Optional. Specifies the resource file to read connection information from.
See L<"ENVIRONMENT"> and L<"FILES">.

=item I<attr>

Optional. Equivalent to \%attr in L<DBI>. I<attr> supplied to C<Connect>
take precedence over those set in the resource file.

=back

Here is an example resource file.

  [section]
  user     = Bob
  pass     = Smith
  dsn      = dbi:mysql:?
  attr Foo = Bar

=over

=item I<user>

Required. The username to connect with.

=item I<pass>

Required. The password to connect with, be sure to protect you resource file.

=item I<dsn>

Required. The C<dbi:> is optional, though it is required for a
B<DBIx::Connect> compatibile resource file.

=item I<attr> attribute

Optional. Equivalent to \%attr in L<DBI>. I<attr> supplied to C<Connect>
take precedence over those set in the resource file.

=back

=head2 C<Delete>

C<Delete> removes records from the database.

  Delete 'From ACCOUNTS Where id=?', $old_customer_id;

In a numeric context, C<Delete> returns the number of records
deleted. In boolean context, C<Delete> returns a success or failure
code. Deleting zero records is considered to be success.

=head2 C<Insert>

C<Insert> inserts new records into the database.
The return value is the same as for C<Delete>.

  Insert 'Into ACCOUNTS',
            {
             id=>undef,             age=>26,
             firstname=>'Michael',  lastname=>'Schwern',
             occupation=>'Slacker', balance=>0.00
            };

Or equivalently:

  Insert 'Into ACCOUNTS '.
         '(id, firstname, lastname, age, occupation, balance) '.
         'Values(?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)',
         undef, 'Michael', 'Schwern', 26, 'Slacker', 0.00;

While you may explicitly include each placeholder, it is inconvenient.
C<Insert> allows the use of C<??L> as an abbreviation for the appropriate
list of placeholders. And so we have the equivalent:

  Insert 'Into ACCOUNTS '.
         '(id, firstname, lastname, age, occupation, balance) '.
         'Values ??L',
         undef, 'Michael', 'Schwern', 26, 'Slacker', 0.00;

If the C<??L> is the last thing in the SQL statement you may omit it,
as well as the word C<'Values'>. And so we have the equivalent:

  Insert 'Into ACCOUNTS '.
         '(id, firstname, lastname, age, occupation, balance) ',
         undef, 'Michael', 'Schwern', 26, 'Slacker', 0.00;

=head2 C<Select>

C<Select> queries the database and retrieves the records that you ask for.
In list context, C<Select> returns a list of selected records. If the
selection includes only one field, you will get back a list of field
values:

  # print out all last names
  @lastname = Select 'lastname From ACCOUNTS';
  for $lastname (@lastname) {
    print "$lastname\n";
  }
  # Select returned ('Smith', 'Jones', "O'Reilly", ...)

If the selection includes more than one field, you will get back a
list of rows; each row will be an array of values:

  # print out all full names
  for $name (Select 'firstname, lastname From ACCOUNTS') {
    print "$name->[1], $name->[0]\n";
  }
  # Select returned (['Will', 'Smith'], ['Tom', 'Jones'],
  #                       ['Tim', "O'Reilly"], ...)

If you simply require the number of rows selected do the following:

  if ((Select 'Count(*) From ACCOUNTS Where balance < 0')[0]) {
    print "Someone is overdrawn.\n";
  } else {
    print "Nobody is overdrawn.\n";
  }

That is, use the SQL C<Count> function, and retrieve the appropriate
element of the returned list. I<This behavior has changed since 0.07>,
where you would simply C<Select> in scalar context.

=cut

XXX kill this eventually --^ & moving to CAVEATS? or just nix mention of prior

=pod

=head2 C<Update>

C<Update> modifies records that are already in the database.
The return value is the same as for C<Delete>.

  Update 'ACCOUNTS Set', {balance=>$balance},
         'Where id=?', $old_customer_id;

Or equivalently:

  Update 'ACCOUNTS Set balance=balance+? Where id=?',
          $deposit, $old_customer_id;

For the first form, if the C<Set> is the last thing in the first clause of
the SQL statement, you may omit it. Likewise the second clause of the SQL
statement, C<'Where id=?'> in the example above, is optional.
And so Robin Hood might:

  Update 'ACCOUNTS', {balance=>1_000_000};

=head1 FMTYEWTK

Far More Than You Ever Wanted To Know. Actually, if you are reading this,
probably not. These are the "advanced" features of B<EZDBI>. They control
B<EZDBI>'s behavior or bridge the gap between B<EZDBI>'s simplicity and
B<DBI>'s power.

=head2 C<use EZDBI maxQuery=E<gt>4>

Set the maximum number of queries to cache I<per database handle>.
The default is 10.

=head2 C<Connect>

C<Connect> returns a database handle upon connection, actually a B<DBI> object.
If no connection information is provided the current database handle
is returned if one exists, otherwise an exception is thrown.

=head2 C<Disconnect>

If you have a long running program that performs minimal interaction
with a database you may wish to C<Disconnect> from the database when
not in use so as not to tie up a connection. Additionally it is probably
not safe to assume in such a situtation that your connection is still
intact. You may provide a database handle or default to the current handle.

  my $dbh = Connect ...;
  ...;
  Disconnect($dbh);
  ...;

=head2 C<Select>

The normal manner of calling C<Select> returns the entire recordset at once,
this may be hazardous to your health in the limit of large recordsets.
C<Select> provides a mechanism for fetching individual records. In
scalar context C<Select> returns an object that may be repeatedly
queried, fetching a row at a time until the recordset is exhausted.
The object can return an arrayref or a hashref.

  my $r = Select('id, name From USERS');
  while( $_ = $r->([]) ){
    printf "ID: %i\n", $_->[0];   #First column of the record
  }
  #OR
  while( $_ = $r->({}) ){
    printf "ID: %i\n", $_->{id};  #The record column named id
  }

If you plan on using any loop control (C<last> is the only sensible option)
you will want to enclose everything in a block. It would be prudent to
do this even if you aren't using C<last>.

  {
    my $r = Select('id, name From USERS');
    while( $_ = $r->([]) ){
      last if $_->[1] eq 'Tim';
      printf "%i\n", $_->[0]; #First column of the record
    }
  }

=head2 C<Sql>

This allows you to execute an arbitrary SQL command which is not abstracted
by B<EZDBI> such as C<Grant>.

  Sql('Drop FOO');

NOTE: Sql does not return a recirdest, as it is implemented with C<DBI::do()>.
As such C<Sql> is not especially useful for commands like MySQL's I<Describe>.

=head2 C<Use>

C<Use> provides the ability to manage multiple simultaneous connections.
It might be compared to B<perl>'s 1-arg C<select> where C<Select> would be
B<perl>'s C<readline>.

  my $dbha = Connect ...;
  my $dbhb = Connect ...;
  Select('plugh From FOO');
  Use($dbha);
  Select('xyzzy From BAR');

You might do this if you had C<Connecte>ed to both FOO and BAR on the
same host. This is perfectly acceptable, but rather wasteful. SQL syntax
allows you to do this more efficiently.

  Connect ...;
  Select('plugh From FOO.BARFLE');
  Select('xyzzy From BAR.ZAZ');

Rather this is most appropriate when connections to databases on seperate
machines need to be maintained.

=head1 ERRORS

If there's an error, B<EZDBI> prints a (hopefully explanatory) message
and throws an exception. You can catch the exception with C<eval { ... }>,
or let it kill your program.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

=over

=item I<DBIX_CONN>

If C<Connect> is called in the B<AppConfig> format but I<ini> is not provided
it will try the file specified by I<DBIX_CONN>.

=item I<HOME>

If I<DBIX_CONN> is not set C<Connect> will try the file F<.appconfig-dbi> in
I<HOME>.

=back

=head1 FILES

=over

=item F<~/.appconfig-dbi>

The last fall back for B<AppConfig> style Connect as documented in
L<"ENVIRONMENT">.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

=over

=item C<Select> in list context

The normal manner of calling select can result in excess memory usage,
see L<"FMTYEWTK">.

=item Other Features

Any other features in this module should be construed as undocumented
and unsupported and may go away in a future release. Inquire within.
